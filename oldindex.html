    <h2>Joke!</h2>
    <p>
      Three hunters were walking in the forest when they encountered some tracks.

      One hunter claims they were bear tracks.

      The second frowns, and says "No, those are certainly badger tracks."

      The third just laughs and says, "Honestly! You two crack me up! Those are obviously baby elephant tracks!"

      And then the train hit them.
